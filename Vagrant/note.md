# Vagrant

## Principles

* Vagrant is developped by Hashicorp.
* Vagrant allows users to configure virtual environment easily. The virtual environment is configure in a vagrant file. This file is written in Ruby.
* Need a virtualisation software pre-installed in the machine ( VirtualBox, VMWare, ...).
* On the Vagrant website, a lot of pre-configured boxes are available.

## Main commands

* `vagrant up` :This command is used to start a vagratn environment from vagrantfiles.
* `vagrant destroy` : This command is required to be used in the vagrant folder. It destroys vagrant resources generated by the vagrantfile.
* `vagrant reload` : Reload the virtual machines and load new configurations.
* `vagrant init` : Initialize environment by creating vagrantfile.
* `vagrant ssh [machine_name]` : Connect to ssh to a vagrant machine.

## Good practices and tips

* In a VagrantFile, it is important to precise the box, network and hostname parameter for the VM.
* It is also possible to execute a shell with the command `config_name.vl.provision "shell, COMMANDS"`
